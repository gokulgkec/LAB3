      <p>Education is the process of continuous growth and is lifelong. Educational Institutions should be the home and repository of fresh thoughts and new orientations. Whatever may be the transformation, it will be clear that education has two main aspects – the cultural aspects which make a person grow and, the production aspect which makes a person do things. These two aspects are not exclusive of each other. Education, science based and coherent with Indian culture and values, alone can provide the foundation for the nation’s security and welfare.</p>
